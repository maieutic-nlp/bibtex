  abstract  = {Multilingual machine translation has proven immensely useful for both parameter efficiency and overall performance across many language pairs via complete multilingual parameter sharing. However, some language pairs in multilingual models can see worse performance than in bilingual models, especially in the one-to-many translation setting. Motivated by their empirical differences, we examine the geometric differences in representations from bilingual models versus those from one-to-many multilingual models. Specifically, we compute the isotropy of these representations using intrinsic dimensionality and IsoScore, in order to measure how the representations utilize the dimensions in their underlying vector space. Using the same evaluation data in both models, we find that for a given language pair, its multilingual model decoder representations are consistently less isotropic and occupy fewer dimensions than comparable bilingual model decoder representations. Additionally, we show that much of the anisotropy in multilingual decoder representations can be attributed to modeling language-specific information, therefore limiting remaining representational capacity.},

The workshop addressed seven critical challenges in spoken language translation: simultaneous and offline translation, automatic subtitling and dubbing, model compression, speech-to-speech translation, dialect and low-resource speech translation, and Indic languages. The shared tasks garnered significant participation, with 32 teams submitting their runs. The field{'}s growing importance is reflected in the increasing diversity of shared task organizers and contributors to this overview paper, representing a balanced mix of industrial and academic institutions. This broad participation demonstrates the rising prominence of spoken language translation in both research and practical applications."
